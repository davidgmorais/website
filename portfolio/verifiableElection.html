          <p>The design of interactions between the trusted and untrusted part of the application were a concern since the beginning of the inception phase, hence they were one of the first aspects to be prototyped, through the EDL syntax. Furthermore, trusted cryptographic algorithms to seal the data, check integrity and generate credentials were studied and choose before the implementation phases </p>
          <p>Specific data structures were defined for each type of  message exchanged between the trusted and untrusted environment, as well as the format of the data to be sealed and stored in order to keep consistency and data integrity.</p>

          <p>Possible limitations include, perhaps and because of its importance, performing the derivation of a key from a password provided by the user outside the enclave, since the purpose of the enclave was not to trust the CPU or memory, to do this operation outside the enclave.</p>
          <p>This could have potential consequences, however none of the trusted cryptographic libraries had anything suitable for generating password-based keys.</p>

          <h4>On a more individual level...</h4>
          <p>This Verifiable Election was inserted in the context of multiple projects where I was a little out of my comfort zone due to the fact that they were developed in a lower programming language. These combined theoretical security concepts with implementations where little documentation was available which resulted in a lot of push and pull at times during the development and, maybe as a consequence of these facts, more knowledge was obtained. Hence, I can safely say that these projects had a lot of additional value taken away from them as a whole.</p>
          <p>However, they also served to prove to myself that I was capable of doing work at a lower level than I am used to, using concepts that I was having some difficulty grasping at first. Throughout them, I came to the resolution that I was more persistent that I gave myself credit for, ending them with a better sense of the work I could accomplish and, honestly, a new-found interest in topics in regards to areas such as this one.</p>
