                        <p>Additionally, segmenting the burn area from a video or images was a challenging task due to the erratic behaviour of flames and heavy smoke obstruction of crucial parts of the frame.</p>

                        <p>With this in mind, the goal of the work centred its attention on improving the already implemented and existing tools as well as creating new ones which consequently eased the effort made by specialists by streamlining and automating the process as a whole.</p>

                        <p>Georeferencing works by selecting points on an image and assigning them a latitude and longitude. By finding the homograph of these points, we can obtain the pixel to geographic positions relation which is then used to enable the creation of a transformation matrix that will convert any point of that image into the corresponding latitude and longitude. Applying this transformation to the polygon obtained from segmentation will make it possible to show it on a map and overlap it on an area of interest.</p>
