                        <p>Great part of the work regarding the visualization and characterization of fire focus areas were being done manually by the engineers, resulting in a slow, repetitive and fastidious process, which could be prone to error.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, segmenting the burn area from a video of images was a challenging task due to the erratic behavior of flames and heavy smoke obstruction of crucial parts of the frame.</p>

                    <div class="col-lg-4 order-3 order-lg-3"  style="padding: 5% 2% 0 2%;">
                        <p>The majority of the tools developed at the time were all CLI based, which resulted in only people with some knowledge or training in the technological area having less problems using.</p>
                        <p>With this in mind, the goal of the work centered its attention on improving the already implemented and existing tools as well as bringing new ones which consequently eased the effort made by specialists by streamlining and automating the process as a whole.</p>

                        <p>An automated classification tool was developed, which takes some user input in the form of the classification of the vegetation in one tile and uses the Euclidean distance between the average color of a classification and the average color of a given tile to predict the values for the vegetation classification in that tile.</p>

                        <p>The tools allow for extraction of frames related to areas of interest from either images or videos. The segmentation module employs an watershed algorithm which takes user clicks and drags as interactive inputs with each frame. The polygon represents the countour of the segmented area, and is only generated with user confirmation.</p>
                        <p>Holes and gaps in the segmentation are ignored by appliing the morphological operations of dilation and erosion, in this order.</p>

                        <p>Georeferencing works by selecting points on an image and assigning them a latitude and longitude. By finding the homograph of these points, we can obtain the pixel to geographic positions relation which is then used to enable the creation of a transformation matrix that will convert any point of that image into the corresponding latitude and longitude. Applying this transformation to the polygon obtained from segmentation will make it possible to show it on a map and overlap it on an area of interest.</p>

                        <p>This data can be exported in formats recognized by third-party applications such as DISPERFIRE, where the burning area and the time when each zone started burning is generated in the form of a matriz and can be exported automatically by the tool developed.</p>
