                        <p>MAIS was developed to support a multi-modal system which implements multiple biometric authentication methods in such a way that, in order for a user to successfully authenticate itself, they must complete both authentication challenges, in resemblance to a two-factor authentication system.</p>
                        <p>The main obstacles on the development of the work was the initial idea requiring some tinkering, where an external system running on a raspberry pi as a server was altered in favour of the authentication system running locally. Furthermore, and after the project delivery, we consider that the goals were met, however the optimal performance of the system is found in an isolated and controlled environment, due to lightning and noise issues.</p>

                        <p>This project allowed me to work in an area of bigger interest to me, that being authentication systems as well as the privacy issues implicated in these, however it also helped me explore biometric forms of authentication that certainly helped me understand a little better both the systems and how they should be built and optimised.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned, the initial idea had to be altered, which was a shame due to the fact that I was eager to implement a biometric system that did not run locally and had to employ communication protocols that assure the secure exchange of very sensitive information over unprotected and untrusted networks.</p>
