                        <p>MAIS was developed to support a multi-modal system which implements multiple biometric authentication methods, in such a way that in order for a user to successfully authenticate itself they must complete both authentication challenges, in resemblance to a two-factor authentication system.</p>
                        <p>The main obstacles on the development of the work was the initial ideal requiring some tinkering, where a external system running on a raspberry pi as a server was altered in favor of the authentication system running locally. Furthermore, and after the project delivery, we consider that the goals were met however the optimal performance of the system is found in an isolated and controlled environment, due to lightning and noise issues.</p>

                        <p>This project allow me to work in an area of bigger interest to me, that being authentication systems as well as the privacy issues implicated in these, however it also helped me explore biometric forms of authentication that certainty helped me understand a little better how these types of systems must be build and optimized.</p>
                        <p>As mentioned the initial ideal had to be altered, which was a shame due to the fact that I was eager to implement a biometric system that did not run locally, and had to employ communication protocols that should be secured in order to swap very sensitive information over unprotected and untrusted networks.</p>
